          is accepted at an odd that is: materially different from those
          available in the general market at the time the bet was made; or
          clearly incorrect given the chance of the event occurring at the time
          the bet was made then we reserve the right to cancel or void that

          of an event incorrectly. If there are insufficient funds in your
          Account, we may demand that you pay us the relevant outstanding amount
          relating to any erroneous bets or wagers. Accordingly, we reserve the
          right to cancel, reduce or delete any pending plays, whether placed
          with funds resulting from the error or not.{" "}

          The winner of an event will be determined on the date of the event’s
          settlement; we do not recognise protested or overturned decisions for

          All results posted shall be final after 72 hours and no queries will

          Minimum and maximum wager amounts on all sporting events will be

          Accounts as well.{" "}

          Customers are solely responsible for their own account transactions.
          Please be sure to review your wagers for any mistakes before sending
          them in. Once a transaction is complete, it cannot be changed. We do
          not take responsibility for missing or duplicate wagers made by the
          Customer and will not entertain discrepancy requests because a play is
          missing or duplicated. Customers may review their transactions in the
          My Account section of the site after each session to ensure all
          requested wagers were accepted.{" "}

          For a wager to have action on any named contestant in a Yes/No

        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          We attempt to follow the normal conventions to indicate home and away
          teams by indicating the home and away team by means of vertical
          placement on the desktop site version. This means in American Sports
          we would place the home team on the bottom. For Non-US sports, we
          would indicate the home team on top. In the case of a neutral venue,
          we attempt to include the letter “N” next to the team names to
          indicate this. For the Asian and mobile versions, we do not
          distinguish between European and American Sports. On the Asian and
          mobile versions of the site, the home team is always listed first.
          However, we do not guarantee the accuracy of this information and
          unless there is an official venue change subsequent to bets being
          placed, all wagers have action.{" "}

        <p>
          {" "}
          A game/match will have action regardless of the League heading that is
          associated with the matchup. For example, two teams from the same
          League are playing in a Cup competition. If the matchup is mistakenly
          placed in the League offering, the game/match will still have action,
          as long as the matchup is correct. In other words, a matchup will have
          action as long as the two teams are correct, and regardless of the
          League header in which it is placed on our Website.{" "}

          If an event is not played on the same date as announced by the
          governing body, then all wagers on the event have no action. If an
          event is posted by us, with an incorrect date, all wagers have action
          based on the date announced by the governing body.{" "}

        <p>15.4.1 The Risk-Based Approach</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In money laundering and terrorist financing, a risk-based approach
          covers the following:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          • The risk assessment of customer relationships and business
          activities;
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          • The risk mitigation to implement controls to handle identified
          risks;
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          • Keeping customer identification, beneficial ownership and business
          relationship information up to date; and
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          • The ongoing monitoring of business relationships and transactions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Existing regulatory obligations, such as for customer identification,
          are a minimum baseline requirement. Where enhanced due diligence is
          appropriate, a principle of the risk-based approach is to focus
          resources where they are most needed to manage risks within our
          tolerance level.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>15.4.2 Risk Mitigation</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Risk mitigation is implementing controls to limit the potential money
          laundering and terrorist financing risks identified in the risk
          assessment so as to stay within the risk tolerance level. When the
          risk assessment determines that risk is high for money laundering or
          terrorist financing, then we will develop risk mitigation strategies
          and apply them.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>In all situations, risk mitigation controls and measures include:</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          • Focussing on operations (products and services, customers and

          Magic365 is required to and will analyse potential threats and
          vulnerabilities to money laundering and terrorist financing to which
          the business may be exposed to in a risk assessment.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>The risk assessment will document and consider the following:</p>
        <br />
        <p>• Products, services and delivery channels</p>
        <br />

        <p>• Customers</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          The risk assessment may identify high-risk situations for which risk
          mitigation controls and monitoring may be required. The risk
          assessment is not static and will change over time.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          Magic365 will identify products and services or combinations of them
          that may pose an elevated risk of money laundering or terrorist
          financing. For example, products and services that support the
          movement and conversion of assets into, through and out of the
          financial system pose a high risk. Certain services have also been
          identified by financial regulators, governmental authorities or other
          credible sources as being potentially high-risk for money laundering
          or terrorist financing.{" "}

        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Certain geographic locations potentially pose an elevated risk for
          money laundering and terrorist financing. These have been described by
          the FATF and by other resources such as Transparency International.{" "}

        <br />
        <p>
          Clients from, or identified as linked to these countries will be

        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          The risk assessment requires to know your customers (“KYC”). This is
          not limited to identification or record keeping, but it is also about
          understanding the customers – including their activities, transaction
          patterns, and how they operate.{" "}

        <br />
        <p>Examples of the factors that will be considered are:</p>

          • How long we have known the customer and had a business relationship;

        <p>• Customers whose who are politically exposed.</p>
        <br />
        <p></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Each customer is risk-rated as either posing a low, medium or high
          risk of money laundering and/or terrorist financing. The rating given
          at the beginning of the business relationship may be adjusted after
          the re-assessment and may change over time. The level of customer due
          diligence will vary depending on the risk rating of the customer at
          the beginning of the relationship and as it changes. For all high-risk
          players, enhanced due diligence is applied right away.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>15.5.4 Regulatory risk</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Regulatory risk means not meeting our obligations under applicable
          legislation. Examples of breaches of regulatory obligations include:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>• Customer identification not done properly;</p>
        <br />

          Magic365 has a training program for all relevant employees and other
          individuals who act on behalf of the Company. The goal of this
          training is to make sure that those who have contact with customers,
          who see customer transaction activity or who handle funds in any way
          understand the reporting, customer identification and record keeping
          requirements.{" "}

          {" "}
          All new employees of Magic365 are required to complete anti-money
          laundering and terrorist financing compliance training within their

          Training is currently conducted through a customised course. The
          training program is delivered electronically (via a learning
          management system). The training program is reviewed and updated by
          the MLRO to reflect requirements as they change. The compliance
          training includes a test which everyone must pass in order to consider
          their training complete.{" "}

        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          To ensure employee training is kept up to date, all existing employees
          will receive follow up training on new and existing AML and regulatory
          requirements on a regular basis (at least within one year of their
          last training). If the online training test results show that a staff
          member does not understanding the training material, Magic365 will
          ensure that the staff member receives specialised one-on-one training
          to understand the material.{" "}

        <p>15.6. Minimum standards – KYC POLICY</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Magic365 has established standards regarding Know-Your-Customer
          (“KYC”). These standards require due diligence on each prospective
          customer before entering into a business relationship via
          identification and verification of his identity and, as the case may
          be, his representatives and beneficial owners on the basis of
          documents, data or information obtained from a reliable and
          independent source compliant with the domestic and European AML/CFT
          legislation and regulation.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Interpretation of the KYC principle begins with identification of the
          customer by means of the necessary identification documents.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          That identification, completed by other information gathered, enables
          the Customer Acceptance Policy to be applied.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          In addition to these objective criteria, there are subjective elements
          which may arouse suspicions regarding a customer and to which
          particular attention should be paid.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Finally, as KYC does not involve static data, but dynamic data through
          the relationship with the customer, it also needs follow-up and
          ongoing monitoring of the customer.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>15.6.1. Customer identification and verification (KYC)</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          The formal identification of customers on entry into commercial
          relations is a vital element, both for the regulations relating to
          money laundering and for the KYC policy.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This identification relies on the following fundamental principles :
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          - Each customer (= each individual person and/or each person involved
          in the case of a legal entity) must be identified by means of original
          supporting documents.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>- These documents will be recorded in a centralised system.</p>
        <br />
        <p>- The identification must be completed by "face-to-face" contact.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          - Distance identification is also authorised and possible within a
          dedicated acceptance process, but limits the opportunity to carry out
          certain transactions or to access certain products.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>- Each person identified must be registered by IT means.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          - A person will not be accepted as a customer if the identification
          process proves to be incomplete.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The specific case of the due diligence exercised on the acceptance of
          politically exposed persons (PEP).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Concrete application at Magic365 is reflected by a specific
          identification procedure for customers referenced as PEP, whatever
          their place of residence.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>15.6.2. Risk Profile calculation</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          To assist in determining the level of AML/CFT due diligence to be
          exercised with regard to the Customer, a “Compliance” risk profile is
          calculated first of all on entry into relations (Low, Medium, High),
          and is then recalculated daily.{" "}

          {" "}
          Client Identification is intended to confirm the existence and
          identify the individual with which Magic365 has a business
          relationship and obtain supporting identity information. This includes
          measures to:{" "}

        <p>• Determining whether any third parties are involved;</p>
        <br />
        <p>

        <p>• Reviewing their background, reputation;</p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <p>15.6.3.2. Identifying Information for Customers</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          This section sets out the standard identification requirements for
          individuals who have entered into a business relationship with
          Magic365. This outline is likely to be sufficient for most situations.
          If, however, the customer is assessed as presenting a higher money
          laundering or terrorist financing risk, in line with our identified
          risk matrix, then Magic365 requires additional identity information to
          be provided and increase the level or verification accordingly.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Where the result of the standard verification check gives rise to
          concern or uncertainty over identity, the number of matches that will
          be required to be reasonably satisfied as to the individual’s identity
          will increase. Any concerns must be reported to the MLRO.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If a customer is unable to produce a primary ID, the reasons for this
          should be noted and they may not be able to maintain an account.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>All documentary evidence must be recent.</p>

        <p>
          {" "}
          In terms of beneficial ownership, we will ask every customer whether

        <p>15.6.3.3. Identity Verification Triggers</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Verification of the identity of the customer occurs either when the
          customer has reached the €2,000 threshold or if the player is
          considered to be a high-risk player upon registration. The main
          trigger for Identity Verification is considered a single transaction
          (or smaller, linked transactions) that reach or exceed €2,000 either
          at deposit or withdrawal stage. For example, transactions will be
          considered as linked when they are carried out by the same customer
          during a single period of being logged on to the Magic365 website or
          if they are carried out in 48 hours.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          In all cases, the customer will receive a notification to upload
          identity verification documents listed above. Each document that is
          provided by customers to Magic365 is checked manually by dedicated
          staff.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Further events that may trigger Identity Verification processes:</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          • When a customer requests a withdrawal to a different account than
          one that was used to make a deposit (e.g. due to the fact that certain
          payment service providers do not support incoming payments or other
          reasons). In these cases, the withdrawal requests will be immediately
          deducted from the customer’s account, however, will not be processed
          until the customer’s identity has been verified to ensure that the
          funds are going to the right person;{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          • When a customer makes multiple deposits within a short timeframe
          (five or more deposits in one hour);
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          • Staff identifies suspicious deposit patterns and or several payment
          cards are used (three or more different payment methods used within
          one week);{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          • Registration country and IP do not match – In such cases, the player
          account may not be blocked and the player may still make deposits and
          play games, however, no withdrawal will be allowed until verification
          has been carried out;{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>• When a deposit exceeds €5,000.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Copies will be kept of all the documents used for identification.</p>
        <br />
        <p>15.6.3.4. Additional Documents</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Additional documents may be requested from customers to substantiate
          their activities or to better understand their patters:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          • Proof of Bank Account – This may be a screenshot or copy of the bank
          statement stating the customer’s name and IBAN and the name of the
          bank (for instances when a customer requests a withdrawal to be
          deposited to a bank account);{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          • Proof of Payment Card – This may be a photo or copy of the front
          side of the card in question or a bank statement that will include
          both the card details and the name of the customer (for instances when
          suspicious deposit patters are identified) –{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          • To protect the customer’s card data, Magic365 informs them that they
          may obfuscate some of the card details, however, the customer’s name,
          as well as the first and last four digits of the card number must be
          visible.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          • Bank Statements and Payslips – These may be requested from customers
          displaying potentially problematic gambling patterns and when external
          information available on the customer does not validate the amounts
          being gambled. In such cases Magic365 would ask its higher volume
          customers for documents which would support the funds being spent on
          gambling.{" "}

        <p>15.6.3.5. Mitigation of Impersonation Risk</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Various additional customer identity checks are permitted on a
          risk-based approach. These checks may include:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          • Requiring the first payment to be carried out through an account in
          the customer’s name with an EU/EEA regulated credit institution or one
          from an equivalent jurisdiction;{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          • Verifying additional aspects of the customer’s identity, or of their
          electronic ‘footprint’;
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          • Telephone contact with the customer prior to opening the account on
          a home or business number which has been verified (electronically or
          otherwise) or a call to the customer before further transactions are
          permitted, using it to verify additional aspects of personal identity
          information that have been previously provided during the setting up
          of the account;{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>15.6.3.6. Keeping Information Up-to-Date</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Once the identity of a customer has been confirmed, it does not have
          to be confirmed again. However, if there is any doubt about the
          information held, then that identification will be obtained again,
          including the identification of the customer.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Magic365 may review the customer documentation and then update it as
          appropriate. Any changes to identification such as a change of name of
          the customer would require new documents to be obtained.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>15.6.4. Ongoing transaction monitoring</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There are certain automated controls in place to monitor customer
          activities, for example:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>• First time deposits;</p>
        <br />
        <p>• Cash-out alerts for cash-outs greater than €1,000;</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          • Activity alerts when customer pays to, or stakes with the casino
          €2,000 during any period of 24 hours;
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          • Credit Card BIN alerts (when Credit Card country differs from player
          account country/IP);
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          In addition, all cash-out requests are processed manually by the
          Payments Team and are reviewed on a daily basis. Every request
          undergoes security checks before approval in order to determine that
          the origin of the funds/wins is compliant with the Gaming Control
          Board Belize Policy and the terms and conditions of the Company.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>15.7. Organization of internal control</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Any member of Magic365 can report suspicious activities to the MLRO,
          as VELKI’s Nominated Officer. A suspicious activity is one where it is
          known, or suspected, there are reasonably grounds to know or suspect
          that a person is engaged in, or attempting, money laundering or
          terrorist financing.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p></p>
        <br />
        <p>15.7.1. Suspicious transactions reporting</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Having knowledge means knowing something to be true. Knowledge can be
          inferred from the surrounding circumstances; so, for example, a
          failure to ask obvious questions may imply knowledge. The knowledge
          must, however, have come to Magic365 during the course of business, or
          from a disclosure (to the MLRO).{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Suspicion is more subjective and falls short of proof based on firm
          evidence. Suspicion is more than speculation and is based on some
          foundation.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          An unusual transaction is not necessarily suspicious. Unusual patterns
          of gambling, including the spending of particularly large amounts of
          money in relation to the casino or customer’s profile, should receive
          attention, but unusual behaviour should not necessarily lead to
          grounds for knowledge or suspicion of money laundering, or the making
          of a report to the FIAU. The MLRO is required to assess all of the
          circumstances and, in some cases, it may be helpful to ask the
          customer or others more questions. The choice depends on what is
          already known about the customer and the transaction, and how easy it
          is to make enquiries.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Members of staff who consider a transaction or activity to be
          suspicious, would not necessarily be expected to know or to establish
          the exact nature of any underlying criminal offence, or that the
          particular funds or property were those arising from a crime, money
          laundering or terrorist financing. “Reasonable grounds to know or
          suspect” introduces an objective test of suspicion. The test is likely
          to be met when there are facts or circumstances, known to the member
          of staff, from which a reasonable person (in a payments firm) would
          have inferred knowledge, or formed the suspicion, that another person
          was engaged in money laundering or terrorist financing.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          A defence of failing to meet the test of suspicion, would be for staff
          to demonstrate that they took reasonable steps to know the customer
          and the rationale for the transaction, activity or instruction.{" "}

        <p>
          {" "}
          Any member of staff, who is suspicious that a transaction may involve
          money laundering or who becomes aware during the course of their work
          that someone else is involved in money laundering, must make a
          disclosure to the MLRO using the Magic365 Suspicious Transaction
          Report form.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Once completed, the form should be printed off. The member of staff
          making the report must sign and date the form before giving it to the
          MLRO. The MLRO will take note of the date and time of report receipt.{" "}

        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Upon receipt of the form by the MLRO, they will then decide what is to
          be done as a result of the report, e.g., whether the matter must be
          reported to Gaming Control board, Belize. or not, or further enquiries
          made and record its decision and the reason for it in the customer
          files. The member of staff concerned must be informed of the decision
          and the reasons for it.{" "}

        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          If the matter is to be referred to GCB, the MLRO or a subordinate will
          complete the FIAU report form and discussing with the reporting member
          of staff how matters with the customer are to be conducted from that
          stage. The GCB report form must be signed off by the MLRO or the CEO.{" "}

          Magic365 must not proceed with a transaction whilst we await consent

          If we hear nothing then we may continue with the transaction but not
          inform the customer about the report. GCB may give consent to proceed
          earlier than this time limit. They may also refuse consent in which
          case they have a further 31 calendar days (including weekends or bank
          holidays) to further consider the report. After this they must either
          begin proceedings or allow the transaction to continue.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The MLRO will submit a softcopy version of the report to the GCB. Any

          {" "}
          There must be no record on the customer file or on the computer system
          which refers in any way to suspicious activity reporting, money
          laundering, etc., to avoid the risk of tipping off. It is a criminal
          offence to inform a customer that a SAR has been submitted, or to

        <p>15.7.3 How to Identify Suspicious Activity</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Transactions may give reasonable grounds to suspect that they are
          related to money laundering or terrorist activity financing regardless
          of the sum of money involved. There is no monetary threshold for
          making a SAR. Suspicious transactions may involve several factors that
          on their own seem insignificant, but together raise suspicion that the
          transaction is related to the commission or attempted commission of a
          money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence, or both. As
          a general guide, a transaction may be connected to money laundering or
          terrorist activity financing when we think that it (or a group of
          transactions) raises questions or gives rise to discomfort,
          apprehension or mistrust.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Magic365 will examine, as far as reasonably possible, the background
          and purpose of all complex, unusual large transactions, and all
          unusual patterns of transactions, which have no apparent economic or
          lawful purpose.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          The context in which the transaction occurs or is attempted is a
          significant factor in assessing suspicion and this will vary from one
          customer to another.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Transactions will be evaluated in terms of what seems appropriate and
          is within normal practices in business and based on our knowledge of
          the customer. The fact that transactions do not appear to be in
          keeping with normal industry practices may be a relevant factor.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Reasonable evaluation of relevant factors, including the knowledge of
          the customer's business, financial history, background and behaviour
          is the basis of assessing suspicion. Behaviour is suspicious, not
          people. We have listed below some indicators to help with this
          assessment.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>15.7.4 Indicators of Suspicious Transactions</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          Certain products, services, activities or channels may pose a higher
          risk of misuse for money laundering. Listed below are several
          anti-money laundering risk indicators or “red flags” that might be
          grounds for suspicion. The list is not exhaustive and not conclusive
          but will be used as a guide for inquiry and follow-up, alongside other
          material.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          A single indicator does not necessarily indicate reasonable grounds to
          suspect money laundering or terrorist financing activity. However, if
          several indicators are present during one or a series of transactions,
          then we will take a closer look at other factors before deciding
          whether the transaction must be reported.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          {" "}
          In the case of a transaction aborted in the belief that the property
          is owned or controlled by or on behalf of a terrorist or a terrorist
          group, then there must be a terrorist property report. If there are
          reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction is related to an
          attempted commission of a terrorist activity financing or money
          laundering offence, then a suspicious transaction report about the
          attempted transaction is also required.{" "}

          behavior patterns (such as shopping, playing sports, eating or
          consumption of alcohol) which are considered to be normal and not
          causing any concern can develop into addiction for some people and
          cause problems. In the same way, bets on sports and gambling can lead

          The basic principle promoted by Magic365 is that the final decision

        <p>
          {" "}
          Self-responsibility of the customer is therefore the most effective

        <p>
          Magic365 does not allow minors (persons under the age of 18) to
          participate in games and make bets. That’s why the confirmation of
          having reached the age of majority and the confirmation of date of
          birth are mandatory requirements during registration. Magic365
          considers the issue of minors taking part in games and betting very
          seriously. In order to offer the best possible protection of minors,
          we also rely on the support of parents and caregivers. Please keep

          A problematic game behavior is considered to be such behavior, which
